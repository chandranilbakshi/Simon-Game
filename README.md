# Simon Game
A simple game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### How to Run?
Just open the HTML file in any browser (Make sure all the other files are present in the same directory)

### Start the game
-Press any key to START. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

-Simon will add signal after each sequence. Repeat the previous signals along with the new one, in order.

-Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

-If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, the sequence of signals ends and you have to start the game all over again.
